- **images/**: Sample images used across various projects.
- **videos/**: Sample videos utilized in relevant projects.

## Installation

To run the notebooks locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

**Installation Steps**:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamgopinathbehera/Image-Processing.git
   cd Image-Processing
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the Notebooks/ directory and open the desired notebook.

Projects Overview
Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

Basic Operations: Reading, displaying, and saving images; drawing shapes and adding text.
Arithmetic Operations: Image addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations.
Image Processing Techniques: Scaling, rotating, blurring, and edge detection.
Video Processing: Capturing video from a camera, playing videos, and saving video files.
Object Detection: Implementing face, eye, and smile detection using Haar cascades.
Background Subtraction: Techniques to separate foreground from background in images and videos.
Interactive Applications: Building tools like color pickers and region of interest (ROI) selectors.
Each notebook provides detailed explanations and code to facilitate understanding and replication.
